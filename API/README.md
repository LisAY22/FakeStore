# Fake Store API 
This is a simple REST API that serves as the backend for the "Fake Store" e-commerce project.
The REST API is responsible of managing the products, applying search filters, and handling the shopping cart logic.

## Technologies
This project was built with:
- Node.js (v24.6.0): JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js
- SQLite3: Database driver for SQLite
- CORS: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

## How to Get Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- Postman (Optional, for testing API endpoints)

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository 
[https://github.com/LisAY22/FakeStore.git](https://github.com/LisAY22/FakeStore.git)
2. Navigate to the API project directory 
```cd FAKESTORE/API```
3. Install all the required dependencies
```npm install```

### Run the server
```node index.js```

By default the server will run at:
```http://localhost:3000```

Note: The first time you run the server, it will automatically create a ```fake-store.db``` file. 
This file is included in the ```.gitignore``` and will not be committed to the repository.
